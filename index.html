              <p>
                When building a website or application, I believe that <b>user focused design</b> is the most important element. However in the modern corporate world it is often overlooked, or worse, completely forgotten.

              <h5 class="about-title">Hi There! I'm Joseph Rizzo</h5>
              <p>
                Design has always been wired in me. Even before i started web developement it was weaved throughout everything I did. If I came across a problem I would pour over possible solutions, despite at the time not having the skillset to implement them.
                If given the opportunity to tinker, I tinkered. Everything needed to be as efficient as possible and I never settled for "that's just the way things work."
                </br></br>
                When the opportunity presented itself at work to create a note template tool, I jumped at it. I knew this was my opportunity to make something special.
                </br></br>
                Since I have had the opportunity to tackle both design and development aspects of the app building process, I have an insight on what is required to make a certain design work. I often find myself designing directly in the code itself as it helps to realize a prototype faster.
                </br></br>
                My core belief is that an application should not just be functional. It has to be a pleasure to use. The UX should <b>guide not force.</b> <b>Teach not show.</b> Most importantly it must be something the user actually <b>looks forward to using.</b>
              </p>

              <h3 class="">What is Invader</h3>
              </br>
              <p>
                Invader is a standardized noting application. It creates unified notes, provides valuable data insights, and guides/trains an associate on how to work a review. Invader was first created in March of 2019 and is still being updated monthly.
              </br>My <b>role</b> on this project are: <b>Research, <b>Design, </b><b>Development, </b><b>Training, </b>and <b>Managing</b></br></br> 
              </p>
              </br>
              <!--Replace with image of fake Invader-->
              <img class="mx-auto d-block" src="assets/images/work/invaderExample/invaderCover.png" width="75%"></img>
            </br>

            <h3 class="">The Problem</h3>
              </br>
            <p>
            From 2017 till early 2019 my department was utilizing a standardized note template out of Google Sheets.
            Due to policy changes, major functionality was going to cease to work in said template. We needed to find a way to standardize notes across the department, as well as minimize effectiveness misses, and increase efficiency.
            </p>
            </br>
            <!--<img class="mx-auto d-block" src="assets/images/work/invaderExample/old.png" width="75%"></img>-->
            </br>

            <h3 class="">The Solution</h3>
          </br>
        <p>
        Rather than simply replacing the current tool, could it be made better? How can you organically guide someone through the optimal review process, without confusing or frustrating the user? 

        </br></br>

        <p>What was born from this question was Invader: a new webapp that houses all templates in one. Depending on the Defense and Rule being worked, a starting group of fields will populate. As the user fills out the template, new options either appear or disappear as needed for their review. This cuts down visual clutter, and helps even a new user understand exactly what was required for a review, on an alert-by-alert basis. This combined with color cues and subtle animations, for required fields or incorrect actions, created an unobtrusive yet powerful guiding workflow that all users could follow.</p>
        </br>
          <img class="mx-auto d-block" src="assets/images/work/invaderExample/img5.gif" width="75%"></img>
        </br>
    <h3>The Colors of Invader</h3>
    </br>
    <p>
    Invader incorporates a color palette that highlights important elements and draws the eye to those elements, while leaving everything else muted.
    </p>
    </br></br>
    <img class="mx-auto d-block" src="assets/images/work/invaderExample/lightcolors.png" width="75%" height= "150px"></img>
    </br>
    <p>
    In the light mode of Invader for example: you have the background and template color being medium gray and white as to not distract the associate's eye. When it comes to the fields themselves, standard fields are a slightly muted blue, whereas required fields that associates need to be aware of, are yellow. Once satisfied, all fields turn green.  If a user attempts to move on without filling out a required field it will turn red, and wiggle, to once again draw the userâ€™s eye to them and inform them that they need to fill it out. 
    </br></br>
    The goal once again, as with the rest of the dynamic template update, was to organically guide the associate through their reviews without distracting or frustrating them.
    </p>
    </br>
    <h3>Smart Banners</h3>
    </br>
     <p>
    The Banner system was designed as a tool to remind users of important details. For example, say there was a recent change to a procedure or there is a step that a user may rarely have to take. Based on selections in the template, Invader can show a banner that animates from the top that houses the reminder for the user. In the past that associate may have missed that task, or would have had to search through emails to find exactly what to do. This was far less intrusive than adding a new field for the user to fill out, yet just as effective.
    </p>
    </br>
    <img class="mx-auto d-block" src="assets/images/work/invaderExample/img6.gif" width="75%"></img>
    </br>
    <h3>The Autoloader</h3>
    </br>
    <p>
    The Autoloader is a new way of speeding up a review. Since most work is done out of a system called Defender, a function was built into Invader where the user could copy the page in Defender and with the push of a button in Invader, have it take that data and parse it out to the fields that could be auto populated. This really helped take the monotony of copying and pasting the same fields each review. 
    </p>
    </br>
    <img class="mx-auto d-block" src="assets/images/work/invaderExample/img7.gif" width="75%"></img>
    </br>
    <h3>Email Templates</h3>
    </br>
    <p>
    The Engagement Management Panel (EMP) was built to solve for a major associate pain point. One of our main systems is for sending emails to customers which can sometimes go down, or be very slow. The EMP helps with this by housing the templates in Invader. If a user performs an action during the review that would warrant an email, the panel will reveal itself and the user can then fill out the fields, copy the email, and send it to the customer. 
    </p>
   
        </br>
        <h3>The Feedback Loop</h3>
          </br>
        <p>
        A small group of people were brought together and a feedback model was created. This is essential to the continued success of the application. With the feedback loop in place, frontline associates now had a voice in what was built into the tool.
        </br></br>
        Bi-weekly priority meetings were established in order to sift through all the feedback that was received. This was accomplished by weighing the impact of any given feedback to help prioritize what would be implemented. Features like the RegCC calculator, darkmode, and additional fields were all added thanks to the feedback of the users.
        </p>
         </br>

        </br>
        </br>
        <h3>The Results</h3>
          </br>
        <p>
        A combination of the workflow design and feedback of the users has led to many successes for the application. There has been an overall increase in items worked per hour department wide, and effectiveness misses have also seen a decline. Also due to the nature of how Invader is managed, it is thought of as the first step in implementing solutions for department problems that may arise.

              <h3 class="">Project Insights</h3>
              </br>
              <p>
                This was a project that spanned 2 weeks. The goal was to take a rapid approach to tackling a problem, then showcase my design process to fellow designers.

                Due to the nature of this project, several assumptions needed to be made. During my true design process, I would have taken additional beneficial steps during the research & solutioning process. Areas that could have been explored further will be *highlighted in yellow over the next slides.

              </p>
              </br>
              <img class="mx-auto d-block" src="assets/images/work/aoExample/aoProjectInsights.png" width="75%"></img>
            </br>

            <h3 class="">The Problem</h3>
              </br>
            <p>
            In the world of Fraud Prevention the job of an Organized associate is to look at a list of seemingly unrelated fraud cases and then, using their attention to detail, find out who those suspects are as well as how they managed to get away with frauding the bank and multiple customers. Their job is to then put together these findings in an easy to understand way and then share it with the rest of the bank so that they are aware of what happened and can take steps towards preventing it from happening in the future.
            </br></br>
            However, manual associate driven processes are leading to a poor associate experience, as well as potential speed losses to the bank.

          </br></br>
          <b>My Hypothesis<b> was that by automating these manual processes into a referral queue and automating notifications to partners, it will reduce operational costs and resolution time end-to-end.  
            </p>
            </br>
            <img class="mx-auto d-block" src="assets/images/work/aoExample/aohypothesis.png" width="75%"></img>
            </br>

            <h3 class="">The Results</h3>
              </br>
            <p>
            At the end of the two week project I had performed user research, wireframing, developed a high fidelity Figma prototype, and created a presentation showcasing the entire process. 

            </br></br>

              <img class="mx-auto d-block" src="assets/images/work/AoExample/aoresults.png" width="75%"></img>
            </br>

        </br>
        <p>
        After presenting to my stakeholder as well as fellow designers, the project is now going from concept to reality, and will be worked into a larger portfolio effort.
        </p>
        </br>
        <img class="mx-auto d-block" src="assets/images/work/aoExample/aoNextSteps.png" width="75%"></img>
        </br>
        <h3>How I Got There: Research</h3>
        </br>
         <p>
        I started with several meetings with Organized subject matter experts, as well as a job survey to gather insight into what associates loved and disliked about their job. 

        I chose to go the associate interview and survey route because it would net me key insights and understanding about how associates saw their job, in the quickest amount of time possible. 

        From this initial research I had <b>3</b> main findings.
        </p>
        </br>


        <img class="mx-auto d-block" src="assets/images/work/aoExample/aoResearch.png" width="75%"></img>
        </br>
        <h3>How I Got There: Maria</h3>
        </br>
        <p>
         I would like you to meet Maria: she is a persona I created modeled off of Organized fraud associates, and the goal now was to see what her typical day looked like.

         </br></br>
        Through Maria I create a pseudo customer journey map visualized through the Organized Work Loop. By mapping out each of the referral types that Maria worked on step by step, I was able to quickly visualize Mariaâ€™s day to day.

        </p>
        </br>
        <img class="mx-auto d-block" src="assets/images/work/aoExample/aoCustMap.png" width="75%"></img>
        </br>
        <p>
        I went this route once again in the interest of time. I was able to get most of the benefits of developing a full customer journey map, but in half the time. 
        <br>
        After this map was created the problem areas were revealed. 
        </p>
        </br>
        <img class="mx-auto d-block" src="assets/images/work/aoExample/aoMariaSad.png" width="75%"></img>
        </br>
        <h3>How I got There: Prototype</h3>
        </br>
        <p>
        Next I worked closely with Organized associates back and forth getting their opinions on design ideas. Over the course of <b>1 week</b> I developed basic wireframes for screens and a high fidelity Figma prototype that users could test.
        </br></br>
        This rapid approach was taken once again due to the nature of the project. By working directly with associates I was able to prototype and test fast. However, this project would have benefited from a design sprint with multiple partners to help identify where designs could be improved upon. This is a step that will be taken now that the work is being adopted.

              <h3 class="">What is Tracker Keeper</h3>
              </br>
              <p>
                Tracker Keeper is an associate scorecard & metrics application that is used across multiple teams & departments. Directors, managers, and associates utilize the tool to see an overall snapshot of their performance on a monthly basis.

                In early 2021 as part of a lend program, I was brought on to assist with the roll-out of the tool for my department. I used this opportunity to make some changes to the overall design and UX of the application.

            <h3>The Problem</h3>
              </br>
            <p>
            Tracker Keeper is a very information dense tool. There are many stats and metrics that a user can dive into and analyze. In its previous state, the users could get lost in the massive ocean of information provided to them. Everything was flat, monotone gray, and blended together. The system also required several clicks to get to popular sections of the tool.

            </br>
             <h3>Making it Standout</h3>
              </br>
            <p>
            The first update I made, was to change up the color-palette of the application. The background was darkened, rounding and shadowing was used to elevate and draw the usersâ€™ attention to the important elements on the page. A primary dark blue color was brought into the application to help tables stand-out, and that color is used consistently throughout the UX.
            </p>
            </br>
              <!--<img class="mx-auto d-block" src="assets/images/work/tkExample/img3.gif" width="75%"></img>-->
            </br>
        <h3>Inform by Color</h3>
        </br>
        <p>
        Expanding on color; a color scale was also brought in to help quickly identify where a user is excelling, or may be falling behind peers. A gradient from red to green now exists across the tables of the application. This solves 2 separate problems - Firstly, it helps the user make sense of the numbers. Secondly, it also allows the abundance of information to be consumed quickly and effortlessly.
        </p>
        </br></br>
        <!--<img class="mx-auto d-block" src="assets/images/work/tkExample/img4.png" width="75%"></img>-->
        
        </br>
        <h3>Getting There Faster</h3>
        </br>
         <p>
        The final challenge, was to solve for the navigation issue. On the homepage of Tracker Keeper a new hover menu was introduced to the department icons. Before this, a user would first need to click their department, then on their team from a drop-down menu. Now the user can go directly to their team metrics using the hover menu.
        </p>
        </br>
        <!--<img class="mx-auto d-block" src="assets/images/work/tkExample/img5.png" width="75%"></img>-->
        </br>
        <h3>The Flow</h3>
        </br>
        <p>
        These navigational changes serve multiple purposes aside from making navigation quicker. The goal was to create a user tailored experience. A department head can go to the main page and see how their department is doing overall. A manager can compare and contrast the associates on their team from the team view and an associate can see an individualized breakdown of their performance on the associate overview. Tracker Keeper now allows a user to drill down to exactly the amount of information they need for their use case, without the extra info they do not need.
